# List of run parameters used by main.py
#
# This set of parameters creates a uniform initial porosity model with
# a cylinder, to compare with analytical solutions of compaction around
# the cylinder. It only computes the zero timestep solution, but this
# can be changed by increasing the tmax parameter.
